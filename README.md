Money is one of the most important aspects to earn a living. There are several ways to earn money. One may do a job or be an entrepreneur. Apart from these, one may even become a smart investor. Some of the trending investment options are Stock Market, Mutual Funds, Gold, Real Estate, etc. For a common man, investment options like Stock Market, Mutual Funds, etc. seem a very complicated and confusing task. A common man is very cautious of the money that he/she is investing on anything. But investment is a very smart and efficient way to earn money.

It is very important that our hard-earned money gets invested at the right place. The system takes input from the user for monthly income, age and occupation. Based on the age, the investment plan is suggested. For people below 18 years of age, the system suggests self-investment options. Because self-investment is the best investment. For people between 18 and 35 years, the plan is suggested based on a popular rule 50-30-20 (50% for needs, 30% for wants, 20% for savings and investments). For people above 35 years, the plan is suggested based on a popular rule 40-20-40 (40% for needs, 20% for wants, 40% for savings and investments). Also, the future value is shown for 2 years, 5 years, 10 years at 12% Compound Interest.

Then the system comprises of four popular Investment Options:
•	Stock Market
•	Mutual Funds
•	Gold Investment
•	Real Estate Investment

Stock Market:
The nature of Stock Market is quite unpredictable. Guessing won't help here. Hence the system studies the historical data and accordingly suggests the user whether to buy, sell or wait using Fuzzy Logic. Also, there is option to see next 30 days predicted values based on data set downloaded in real time from Yahoo Finance. This is done using the Machine Learning Algorithm LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). There are options to create an account and start investing along with the links to video tutorials for the same. For beginners, there are options to know the basics of Stock Market, various financial terms, etc.

Mutual Funds:
In the Mutual Funds module, there are various options such as start investing, get to know some of the most popular mutual funds, etc. For beginners, there are options such as knowing the basics of Mutual Funds, why should I invest in Mutual Funds and some other FAQs.

Gold Investment:
In this module, the historical data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance in real time and using Machine Learning Algorithm Linear Regression. Also, various graphs are plotted in real time for a better visualization. The system also shows the predicted value for Gold and suggests user whether he/she should invest for wait for some time based on market conditions. For beginners, there are options to know more about Gold Investment. Also, the user can see real time trends at the click of a button.

Real Estate Investment:
In this module, the land prices are predicted based on previous 5 years data taken from the user as land rates differ from region to region. Also, the graph is plotted for the next 10 years predicted prices. This is done using Machine Learning Algorithm Linear Regression. There is also an option to estimate land prices for any specified year.

Scope:
•	In this system, prediction and recommendation is done which may or may not be accurate as per the real-world scenarios.
•	For this system, Internet connection is required as most of the data is downloaded in real time. Hence, the system won’t properly function without Internet connectivity.
•	To reduce the processing time, only the popular and trending stocks are considered. But more stocks can be added whenever required.
•	As of now, the system is limited to Indian financial market.

Objectives:
•	To make people aware of the various investment options available
•	To create a system which can suggest the user an investment strategy based on his/her needs
•	To predict the future values using Machine Learning Algorithms such as LSTM
•	To predict the future prices for Real Estate using Linear Regression along with providing some suggestions
•	Tell the user whether he should buy, sell or hold while dealing with stock market using Fuzzy Logic
•	To suggest user an investment plan based on parameters such as monthly income, age, occupation
